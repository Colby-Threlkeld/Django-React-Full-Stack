# üåê FullStackDeployLab: Django + React Practice Project

> My personal sandbox for mastering full-stack architecture, integration, and deployment workflows with Django REST Framework and React.

This project is a complete full-stack setup designed to help myself **practice**, **debug**, and **deploy** modern backend and frontend services separately. From JWT authentication to Render deployment, this lab is my way of building confidence using real-world development stacks.
